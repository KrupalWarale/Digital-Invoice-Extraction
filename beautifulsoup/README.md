# BeautifulSoup

**Description:**
BeautifulSoup is used for parsing and extracting data from XML files, typically after converting PDFs to XML format.

**Pros:**
1. Flexible for navigating and extracting custom XML tags.
2. Easy to use for post-processing structured data.
3. Works well with other Python libraries for data manipulation.

**Cons:**
1. Cannot parse PDFs directly; requires prior conversion to XML.
2. Slower for very large XML files.
3. Limited to XML/HTML parsing, not suitable for table detection in PDFs.
